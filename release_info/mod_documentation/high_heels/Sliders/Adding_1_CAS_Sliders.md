# Oops19 High Heels Mod - Adding CAS Sliders
## Introduction

To add a CAS slider make sure that the HotSpot Control is not yet used. Overwriting these may fail, installing multiple sliders from various creators does not improve this situation.

An existing slider can be cloned to replace the used sliders. This documentation describes how to setup Hotspot Controls for female and male teen to elder sims. With other selections it should work for toddlers, children and pets.

Detecting collisions of used slider controls are not part of this document. If the new slider does not work as expected remove all mods except of your new slider.

When using [CmarNYCs](https://modthesims.info/m/3216596) [TS4 Morph Maker](https://modthesims.info/d/613061/ts4-morphmaker-updated-to-v4-3-on-6-9-2020.html) there is a preview window which does ignore some IK points.
Sliders may have completely different results in-game.

Both descriptions make use of abbreviations to keep them compact. They are text only without images or videos.

These styling conventions are used:

    [Button-Text] - The button to press
    a|b|c|... - Option list, choose one
    [x] - The option(s) to select
    [ ] - The option(s) to deselect
    (hint) - Hints or comments
    Normal text should match normal text as seen in Morph Maker
    'Oops19' - Author, replace with your name
    '...' - Placeholder for various options or text

Depending on the morph there may be CAS sliders for:

    f = Front (Front)
    ¾r = 3/4 Right (Threequater_right)
    ¾l = 3/4 Left (Threequater_left)
    r = Profile Right (Profile_right)
    l = Profile Left (Profile_left)
    b = Back (Back)

Even more abbreviations:

    TCTYAE = Toddler, Child, Teen, Young Adult, Adult, Elder
    TYAE = Teen, Young Adult, Adult, Elder
    F = Female
    M = Male

And finally some hints:

    ⁰ not modified
    ¹ Left/Right/Up/Down: click [Change] and select the NEW modifier
    ² Left/Right/Up/Down: click [Change], [Remove Sim Modifier].
